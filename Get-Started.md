# 4 Ways to Create and Use Linux

There are multiple ways to create and use Linux for both RHEL9/Ubuntu 22.04. Here are four common methods:

1. **Virtual Box Installation**: VirtualBox is a popular virtualization software that allows you to create and run virtual machines on your computer. To create and use Linux on VirtualBox, follow these steps:
    - Download and install VirtualBox on your host operating system.
    - Download the ISO image of the Linux distribution you want to use (e.g., RHEL9 or Ubuntu 22.04).
    - Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox and configure its settings, such as memory, storage, and network.
    - Start the virtual machine and install Linux using the ISO image you downloaded.
    - Once the installation is complete, you can use Linux within the virtual machine.

2. **VMware Installation**: VMware is another popular virtualization software that allows you to create and run virtual machines. To create and use Linux on VMware, follow these steps:
    - Download and install VMware on your host operating system.
    - Download the ISO image of the Linux distribution you want to use.
    - Create a new virtual machine in VMware and configure its settings, similar to VirtualBox.
    - Start the virtual machine and install Linux using the ISO image.
    - Once the installation is complete, you can use Linux within the virtual machine.

3. **Cloud-based Installation**: If you prefer to use Linux on the cloud, you can create and use Linux instances on platforms like AWS EC2. Here's how:
    - Sign up for an AWS account and navigate to the EC2 service.
    - Launch a new EC2 instance and select the desired Linux distribution (RHEL9 or Ubuntu 22.04).
    - Configure the instance settings, such as instance type, storage, and security groups.
    - Launch the instance and connect to it using SSH or other remote access methods.
    - Once connected, you can use Linux on the EC2 instance just like you would on a local machine.

4. **WSL2 Installation**: If you are using a Windows machine and want to run Linux, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) with Ubuntu. Here's how to set it up:
    - Enable WSL2 feature on your Windows machine by following the official Microsoft documentation.
    - Install Ubuntu from the command prompt or powershell as per instructions.
    - Launch Ubuntu from the Start menu or by running `wsl` command in the command prompt.
    - Follow the initial setup instructions to create a new user and set a password.
    - You can now use Ubuntu on WSL2 to run Linux commands and applications directly on your Windows machine.


These are four common ways to create and use Linux on both RHEL9 and Ubuntu 22.04. Choose the method that best suits your needs and preferences. Happy Linux-ing!
